module DataFixup::PopulateRootAccountIdOnModels

  # migration_tables should be a hash of a model and the association that has access to the root_account on that model
  # migration_tables should not need to be ordered, the job will try to determine if the required association
  # backfill has been completed, and wait to run it later when the requirements have completed if necessary.
  # You can use an array of associations if needed.  The column name will be assumed to be root_account_id
  # unless the association is a hash. Column names will be used in the order they are provided.
  # Ex: migration_tables = {
  #   Submission => [{assignment: [:root_account_id, :id]}, :user],
  #   OriginalityReport => :submission
  # }
  #
  # If you have a table where you want to use a polymorphic association, but you want to skip one of
  # the associated tables, you'll want to use the long form of the polymorphic association and skip
  # the association you don't want
  # Ex: migration_tables = {Attachment => :context} would turn in to
  # Attachment => [:account, :assessment_question, :assignment, :attachment, :content_export,
  #   :content_migration, :course, :eportfolio, :epub_export, :gradebook_upload, :group, :submission,
  #   :purgatory, {:context_folder=>"Folder", :context_sis_batch=>"SisBatch",
  #   :context_outcome_import=>"OutcomeImport", :context_user=>"User", :quiz=>"Quizzes::Quiz",
  #   :quiz_statistics=>"Quizzes::QuizStatistics", :quiz_submission=>"Quizzes::QuizSubmission"}] normally, but
  # if we want to avoid the users association, we could put it in the hash as
  # Attachment => [:account, :assessment_question, :assignment, :attachment, :content_export,
  #   :content_migration, :course, :eportfolio, :epub_export, :gradebook_upload, :group, :submission,
  #   :purgatory, {:context_folder=>"Folder", :context_sis_batch=>"SisBatch",
  #   :context_outcome_import=>"OutcomeImport", :quiz=>"Quizzes::Quiz",
  #   :quiz_statistics=>"Quizzes::QuizStatistics", :quiz_submission=>"Quizzes::QuizSubmission"}]
  #
  # You can also overwrite one table from a polymorphic association in the case where you might need a
  # different column from one of the polymorphic tables.  To do this, put the overwriting table at the end
  # For example, Group can have a context of account or course.  Account root accounts can come from
  # root_account_id or id
  # Ex: migration_tables = {Group => [:context, {account: [:root_account_id, :id]}]}
  #
  # NOTE: This code will NOT work with any models that need to have multiple root account ids
  # or any models that do not have a root_account_id column.
