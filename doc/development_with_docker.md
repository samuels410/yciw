# Using Docker for Canvas Development

You can use Docker in your development environment for a more seamless
way to get started developing Canvas.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

On OS X, make sure you have the following installed:

#### VMWare Fusion

Preferred over VirtualBox for performance reasons.

#### Vagrant (with VMWare Fusion plugin)

Required for Dinghy to work with VMWare Fusion.

#### Dinghy

```
$ brew install https://github.com/codekitchen/dinghy/raw/latest/dinghy.rb
$ dinghy up --memory=4096 --cpus=4 --provider=vmware_fusion --proxy
```

Type `docker ps` in your terminal to make sure your Docker environment
is happy.

Dinghy currently requires OS X Yosemite. Make sure you're using the most recent
Dinghy release, or else you'll probably have a bad time.

#### Docker-Compose

```
$ brew install docker-compose --without-boot2docker
```

### Bootstrapping

With those dependencies installed, go to your Canvas directory and run
the following:

(this will take awhile as containers are built and downloaded.)

```
$ docker-compose run --rm web bundle install
$ docker-compose run --rm web npm install
```

The `docker-compose/config` directory has some config files already set up to use
the linked containers supplied by config. You can just copy them to
`config/`:

```
$ cp docker-compose/config/* config/
```

Get your database set up and assets built:

```
$ docker-compose run --rm web bundle exec rake db:create
$ docker-compose run --rm web bundle exec rake db:initial_setup
$ docker-compose run --rm web bundle exec rake canvas:compile_assets
$ docker-compose up
```

Now you can open Canvas at http://canvas.docker/


## Normal Usage

Normally you can just start everything with `docker-compose up`, and
access Canvas at http://canvas.docker/.

After pulling new code, you'll probably want to run migrations and
update assets:

```
$ docker-compose run --rm web bundle exec rake db:migrate
$ docker-compose run --rm web bundle exec rake canvas:compile_assets
```

Changes you're making are not showing up? See the Caveats section below.
Ctrl-C your `docker-compose up` window and restart.


## Running tests

```
$ docker-compose run --rm web bundle exec rspec spec
```

### Selenium

The container used to run the selenium browser is commented out of the
docker-compose file by default. To run selenium, just uncomment those lines,
rerun `docker-compose build`, and when you run your tests you can watch
the browser:

```
$ open vnc://secret:secret@selenium.docker/
```
